# Tino Shockwave Opmodes

This is the custom Tino Shockwave SDK that can be used to create an FTC Robot Controller app, with custom op modes.
The FTC Driver Station app is needed to use the Robot Controller.

 * The folder "apk" contains the .apk files for the Driver Station and Robot Controller apps.
 * The folder "javadoc" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.
 * The folder "tutorial" contains PDF files that help teach the basics of using the FTC SDK.
