# Opmodes

##NOTE: The 2015-2016 FTC season is now over. Until next season, any future commits will only update the app.

This is an FTC Robot controller that contains Tino Shockwave's Opmodes.
The FTC Driver Station app is needed to work with the Robot Controller app included in this SDK.
The FTC Driver Station app is available through Google Play.

To use this SDK, download/clone the entire project to your local computer.
Use Android Studio to import the folder  ("Import project (Eclipse ADT, Gradle, etc.)").

Documentation for the FTC SDK are included with this repository.  There is a subfolder called "doc" which contains several subfolders:

 * The folder "apk" contains the .apk files for the FTC Driver Station and FTC Robot Controller apps.
 * The folder "javadoc" contains the JavaDoc user documentation for the FTC SDK.
 * The folder "tutorial" contains PDF files that help teach the basics of using the FTC SDK.
